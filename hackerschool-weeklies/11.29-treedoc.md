# Commutative replicated data types

* CRDTs (commutative replicated data types) are data structures whose operations commute
* Replicates can be modified by independent actors in a distributed system, and merged together after the fact
* Final result after merging is guaranteed to be consistent

CRDTs are tricky---most natural operations aren't commutative

# Ordered set

* Treedoc implements an ordered set as a CRDT
