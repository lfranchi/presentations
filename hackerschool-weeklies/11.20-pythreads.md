# Intro to Python threading

* Use Python's `threading` module, *not* `thread`.
* Run any function in a secondary thread:

---
    t = Thread(target=thread_func, args=[...])
    t.start()

* Will execute independently in the background
* Can join a thread (to block until thread has exited): `thread.join()`

## Concurrency primitives

* `threading` provides a mutex: `threading.lock`
* `threading` provides lower-level concepts like events: `threading.event`
* `threading` provides thread-local variables: `threading.local`
