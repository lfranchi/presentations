# Basic commutative replicated data types

I previously talked about CRDTs in the context of treedoc, an ordered set. Here we'll see some simpler CRDTs to illustrate common techniques for designing them

## Main features

* Operations that happen at different replicas must commute
* Operations must be idempotent

## Sets

 `add` and `remove` in a set do not commute (order matters). So we can only approximate a set in various ways:

* Grow-only set: easiest of all
* How to handle conflicting add and remove operations?
    * Give precedence to remove: Two-phase set
    * Give precedence to add: Observed-remove set
* Tombstones---keep track of items that were removed, in order allow commutativity

### Conclusion

* Extra legwork needed to maintain CRDT behaviour: usually tombstones, to ensure removes are maintained.
* Can only clean up with GC---requires synchronization
