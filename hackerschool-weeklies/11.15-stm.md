# Software Transactional Memory #

* Concurrent access to shared state is hard
    * Mutexes, read-write locks, semaphores, lock-free algorithms, memory ordering semantics
* Hard to think about, hard to code properly

* STM is a way to move the complexity of shared state to the language. 
    * Optimistic (assumes no conflicts) rather than pessimistic (exclusive locking for any access)

## Features ##

* Atomic commits to outside observers (of multiple variables at once)
* Snapshot of the world
* Transparent retries

# Developer happiness! #
